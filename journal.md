We are trying to figure out the issues we are having with importance sampling. 
Here I have three exampling using simulated data from normal, exponential and gamma distribution. 
A cool observation I got is looking at the pair plots, parameter vs imp_weights looks uniform-ish for parameters without constrain and "S" shape if it is strictly positive.
